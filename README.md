This project is for my own personal use, others are welcome to use it as well. Teamfight Tactics(TFT) is a gamemode in League of
Legends that uses characters within the main game to fight tactically against your opponents. This project provides a variety of data that
allows players to look at if in need of assistance during game.

### Goals

x = complete

```
Main Page [x]
