This project is for my own personal use, others are welcome to use it as well. Teamfight Tactics(TFT) is a gamemode in League of
Legends that uses characters within the main game to fight tactically against your opponents. This project provides a variety of data that
allows players to look at if in need of assistance during game.

#goals

```Main Page [x]

Item Page [x]

Champion Page []

Little Legends Page []
```

Additional ideas:

```

Create tooltips for Item Page []

Create tooltips for Champion Page []

Create tooltips for Little Legends Page []

Use twitch.tv api to embed certain streamers rather than redirecting to the overall game []

```
